#Facial Recognition Application using Siamese Neural Network
This Facial Recognition Application is built from scratch utilizing the Siamese Neural Network architecture. Developed with the aim of distinguishing real faces from fake ones, the application serves as a crucial component in security and identity verification processes. Key Features: Siamese Neural Network: The core of the system is powered by a Siamese Neural Network model, meticulously trained and tested using TensorFlow. This architecture excels at discerning subtle differences between authentic faces and their photographic representations. Real-time Verification: The user interface, designed with Kivy, offers a live camera feed and intuitive buttons for seamless interaction. Upon detection, the application dynamically identifies real faces and flags photos as "Unverified" if presented. Practical Applications: With practical applications across various fields, including access control systems and authentication processes, the Facial Recognition Application enhances security and verification procedures in different organizations. User-friendly Interface: By combining modern neural network technology with a user-friendly interface, the project provides an intuitive and powerful tool for distinguishing between genuine and fake facial representations in real-world scenarios.
